	<h1> Assignment 1 - Petite Treats</h1>
		<p> Abhinav Ranjan (jc833953)</p>
	
	<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
		<p> The project is to build a website for Petite Treats, a small bakery in Kirwan. The customer is looking to create a presence online to improve their business by getting new users and also making it more convenient for current customers. </p>
	
	<h2>Goal</h2>
		<p> The goal is to build a good, customer centric website for a small bakery in Kirwan which will lead to an increase in sales and make their business more competitive in the modern world which is moving increasingly online. </p>
	
	<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
		<p> The site would be considered successful if business for Petite Treats, both from new and repeat customers, increases noticably after a few months of the website being online. </p>
	
	<h2>Target Audience</h2>
		<p> Target audience is mostly young families and young people around the age of 17-35. The catering service is geared more towards businesses. </p>
	
	<h2>Font and Style</h2>
		<p> I intend to use a light theme with #fefefe (almost white) as the background colour and #222222 (dark grey) as the font colour, some elements (like the specials button) will be in a different colour to attract attention of potential customers. I will be using the Helvetica font with Arial and Sans Serif as secondary backup fonts. </p>
	
	<h2>Budget</h2>
		<p> The expected costs are as follows: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Domain: $30 per year </li>
			<li> Hosting: $30 per month (may increase as traffic grows) </li>
			<li> Development: $2000 one time </li>
			<li> Future changes to the site and maintainance: As required </li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Project Timeline</h2>
		<p> The expected timeline is as follows: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Week 1: Initial development </li>
			<li> Week 2: Test deployment and client input. If required, changes will be made to the site. </li>
			<li> Week 3: More testing and final deployment. </li>
